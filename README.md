## A Brief Introduction
A Renren App, to help you figure what to eat today~

Are you always confused about what to eat today? As there are too many choices, it is hard to make a decision. So we want to develop a Renren App, to choose food randomly for you~

## Platform
It is a `Djanjo / Python 2` web app running on [Openshift](http://openshift.redhat.com).

## To-do List
We may also develop the following features:
